## FAQ Section

### Section Title
Questions from Fellow VPs

### Q1: How is this different from ChatGPT or other AI tools?
**A:** VP of One is purpose-built for executive needs. Our AI assistants understand business context, can access and analyze your actual data, and produce executive-ready outputs. Think of it as the difference between a Swiss Army knife and a full professional toolkit.

### Q2: How long does it take to see results?
**A:** Most VPs report significant time savings within the first week. By week two, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it. Full transformation typically happens within 30 days.

### Q3: Is my company data secure?
**A:** Absolutely. We maintain SOC 2 Type II compliance, use enterprise-grade encryption, and never train our models on your data. Your information is more secure with us than in most email systems.

### Q4: What if I need help with industry-specific tasks?
**A:** Your AI assistants are custom-trained on your industry, company, and role. During onboarding, we ensure they understand your specific context and challenges.

### Q5: Can this really replace human assistants?
**A:** VP of One complements human talent rather than replacing it. For VPs without any support, it provides essential leverage. For those with limited support, it amplifies your team's impact.
